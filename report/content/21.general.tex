\subsection{Description of dataset}
The dataset comprises of \( 300 \) raw records and \( 12 \) different features. Although the data is already cleaned, there are 2 records with \( \texttt{blood.disorder} = 0 \), noting that no data was recorded in this field. We will simply remove these \( 2 \) records from our dataset.

% \textbf{The \texttt{vessels} variable}. Despite being an integral feature, it only ranges from 0 to 4. For our purposes, we will consider \texttt{vessels} as a categorical variable of 5 factors \( \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\} \).
