\subsection{Conclusion}
The dataset is a cleaned, 300-record dataset that shows the relationship between demographical and clinical features and the presence of heart disease. A combination of numerical and categorical variables are featured in this dataset, and whilst most features have strong correlation with the response variable, some features seem to be a weak predictor to heart disease (such as \texttt{fbs}, \texttt{bp} or \texttt{chol}). In further sections, models with or without this set of features will be tested against each other.
