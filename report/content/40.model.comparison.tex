As previous chapter selects the top candidate(s) from three family of models, this chapter describes the full validation of the models and report the most notable results from the process.

The data pipeline starts with a full dataset of \( n = 300 \) records, two of which with unrecorded fields are then removed. A derivation of the dataset is generated by applying Box-Cox transformation and standardisation to all features, regarding categorical values as if they were numerical. The derived dataset is then fed to the \( 19 \)-NN model for training, whilst other models (logistic, decision trees) are given the cleaned, untransformed dataset. Each model produces a corresponding prediction result, which are then evaluated on the basis of (a) ROC-curve / AUC-score and (b) Precision â€” Recall curve.
